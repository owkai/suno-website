                <h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Hangzhou Xinglu Network Information Technology Co., Ltd (“we”) has developed our products and services.
This privacy policy explains how we collect, use and share data through our products and services and we refer to these together as the “Apps”.
We reserve the right to and may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, we will notify you through the Apps, or by presenting you with a new version of this Privacy Policy for you to accept, if we, for example, add new processing activities or collect some additional Personal Data from you. Please also periodically check back for updates. You can see the last updated date for this Privacy Policy at the bottom of the policy.
We provide you with this Privacy Policy to make our users aware of the steps we take to ensure the security of their data when utilizing the Apps. This policy describes the types of information we collect when you use the Apps, how we use and protect that information, how long we retain it, and with whom we share it. It also explains what your rights and options are as they pertain to privacy. By using the Apps, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Your personal data
When you use our Apps, you may, in the process, give us data directly, from third parties, or through the Apps themselves (including through your interaction with the Apps) and we collect these data.
These data are, for example:
Usage activity about how you interact with us such as purchase history, what content you viewed, and which areas of our Apps you visited.
Information about your mobile device such as model operating system, identifier and similar information.
Other information that helps us in providing and servicing the Apps.
If you contact our customer support, then we may also receive information from you as part of that contact. Oftentimes this is your name, email and information about your device.
When you utilize one of the Apps, our server automatically records certain information, which is sent by your mobile device and stored in log files. This includes your unique mobile device identifier and similar data. We use this information for statistical and other internal business purposes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ways that we process your data
To manage and develop our Apps, we need information from you, which includes personal information. The purposes of processing this personal data includes:
enabling our support team to contact you regarding support requests
sending you push internal notifications. If you do not want to receive these notifications, you can manage your preferences either through your device or Apps settings.
analyzing, operating, maintaining and improving the Apps and marketing activities
optimizing user experience
adding new features and services to the Apps
responding to your comments, questions and requests and providing customer service.
Analytics are important to help us manage, protect and provide the Apps by obtaining information about how our users interact with our application. For example, we will receive the length of time spent in a session within the Apps, aggregate, non-specific geographic data, and crash data. Some Apps have the ability to send bug reports to us, which include the user’s email address and an optional description of the problem, along with some auto-generated technical information. These reports are strictly voluntary and are only sent when the user after reviewing them expressly grants permission. If you choose to send us this data, then we will use this information to ensure that the Apps continue to appeal to our users, as well as for auditing, research, and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve the app; ensuring the technical functioning of the app, as well as developing new apps.
We may combine your usage information with that of others in a way that does not identify you or any individual person and to use such anonymized and aggregate data for conducting analytical research, performance tracking and benchmarking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your rights
You are able to modify, correct and update your Personal Data in the Apps account settings. If you want to erase it from our analytics tools please write us at aisingapp@gmail.com
You have a right to access your Personal Data you insert into the Apps and ask us about what kind of Personal Data we have about you. You can do this by using the app settings or by writing to aisingapp@gmail.com.

Right to correct or update your personal data
Right to restrict processing of your personal data
Right to portability
Right to withdraw consent if we have asked for it

In case this is impossible, we reserve the right to refuse granting your request.
Following the provisions of GDPR we might also require you to prove your identity (for example, by requesting an ID or any other proof of identity) in order for you to invoke the mentioned rights, specifically if you exercise them in respect to special categories of Personal Data like data about health. This is made to ensure that no rights of third parties are violated by your request, and the rights described in this section are exercised by an actual Personal Data subject or an authorized person.</p>
  </li>

· Provide you with advertisements and information for products and services in this app or on other apps or websites based on variables such as your location, and assess your level of engagement with them; and

These are the third-party services with whom, among others, we may share some of your Personal Data and information.</p>

Once you’re a subscriber, you can manage your subscription from iTunes or on your iOS unit after purchasing it, and you’ll also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there. Deleting the app does not cancel the subscription. You can, however, cancel a subscription even after you’ve deleted the app. The subscription will auto-renew 24 hours before the subscription period ends, with the same kind of subscription you already bought, to the same price.
You may at any time terminate your membership, in which case your membership will still be valid for the subscription time you have already paid for. Our auto renewable In-app purchase subscriptions can only be cancelled using the App Store cancelation service. If you would like to contact Apple, please use this link https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039. Subscription fees can be found in the mobile applications. We reserve the right to change the subscription fees from time to time.</p>
